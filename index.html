    <h1>NOTOUCH</h1>
    <p>This is the official website of the NOTOUCH token. Welcome! :)</p>
    <h2>What is NOTOUCH?</h2>
    <p>It's a digital coin built on <a href="https://ton.org">TON</a> blockchain. We just were interested in how all that crypto thing works. So we launched this token via <a href="https://minter.ton.org">TON minter</a></p>
    <p>This is a hobby project. Maybe sometime it will grow into something more...</p>
